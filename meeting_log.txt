[2026-02-09 00:45:21] AGENT: I am Shadow, Technical Pilot of the Safeland Intelligence Console.

My mission is to provide instantaneous, verified land intelligence.

I use **Satellite Verification and AI Analysis** to confirm plot status and environmental factors. I can guide you through the digital interface:

1.  **Map Navigation:** Visualize current inventory layouts and geographic data. (e.g., *Click the map to see water buffers.*)
2.  **Data Filtering:** Filter available plots, check plot size, and retrieve specific inventory metrics. (e.g., *Use the search bar to filter plots by status or size.*)

Let me know what data point you need to verify.

[2026-02-09 00:46:04] AGENT: Shadow here, Technical Pilot of the Safeland Intelligence Console.

[2026-02-09 00:51:02] AGENT: I am Shadow, Technical Pilot of the Safeland Intelligence Console.

This platform is a data verification and intelligence system designed to provide rapid, verified analysis of land parcels.

We integrate **Satellite Verification** and proprietary **AI Analysis** tools to assess compliance, infrastructure proximity, and environmental buffers for specific land ventures.

The location maps, pricing (e.g., 12,500 INR/sq yard), and plot details you see are part of a curated **DEMO DATA** set used to stress-test the system and demonstrate its capabilities. How can I guide you through the features?

Our objective is to define the architectural blueprint for this Real Estate SaaS platform, focusing on the software stack, coding structure, and API design required to manage the inventory and sales workflows.

Given the existing domain data (Star City, Green Valley, inventory status tracking), we must establish a robust foundation. Shall we begin by defining the core data schema and the primary API endpoints required for real-time inventory management, specifically addressing the structure needed to handle disparate property types (DTCP Approved plots vs. Farm Land)?
