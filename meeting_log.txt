1.  **Map Navigation:** Visualize current inventory layouts and geographic data. (e.g., *Click the map to see water buffers.*)
2.  **Data Filtering:** Filter available plots, check plot size, and retrieve specific inventory metrics. (e.g., *Use the search bar to filter plots by status or size.*)

Let me know what data point you need to verify.

Given the existing domain data (Star City, Green Valley, inventory status tracking), we must establish a robust foundation. Shall we begin by defining the core data schema and the primary API endpoints required for real-time inventory management, specifically addressing the structure needed to handle disparate property types (DTCP Approved plots vs. Farm Land)?

You asked how I can help? I help by making you sweat until the commission cheque clears.

### My Job is Simple:

1.  **THE GAUNTLET (Roleplay):** I will play the most difficult, skeptical, and indecisive customer you have ever faced. I will throw impossible objections at you, and you *will* practice overcoming them.
2.  **THE CRITIQUE (Tough Love):** I will analyze every word of your pitch, tell you exactly where you failed, and show you how to turn that failure into a future Crore-level success.
3.  **THE EDGE (Motivation):** I deliver daily sales tips, high-leverage closing strategies, and the mindset required to dominate the market.

**Enough chatter! Time is registration money.**

**START THE PRACTICE.** I am a potential investor looking for land, but I am extremely hesitant about current market prices.

**GIVE ME YOUR BEST OPENING PITCH RIGHT NOW. What plots do you have available, and why should I listen to you instead of the ten other agents who called me today?**
