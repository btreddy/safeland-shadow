🌍 Safe Land: The Intelligence Console
User Guide & Frequently Asked Questions

For Agents & Sellers: How to Grow Your Business
Q: How is Safe Land different from other property portals? A: Other portals just give you a list of text and vague locations. Safe Land is built on Truth. We use satellite precision. You don't just "post an ad"; you pin the exact physical location on the map. This builds instant trust with buyers because they can see the surroundings (roads, neighbors, lakes) before they even call you.

Q: I am an Agent. If I share a Safe Land link, will the lead go to the Owner or me? A: The lead goes to YOU. We built a smart "Agent Multiplier" feature.

Click the Share button on any ad.

Enter your mobile number when asked.

The app generates a unique link. When you share that link, the "WhatsApp" button on the ad updates to route customers directly to your phone, not the original owner's. You keep 100% of your leads.

Q: Can I showcase my venture privately without showing competitors' ads? A: Yes! We offer an "Exclusive Portal" mode for developers and top-tier agents. We provide you with a special link (e.g., safelanddeal.com/?exclusive=YOUR_ID). When you send this to clients, the map filters out everyone else and only shows your inventory. It looks and feels like your own private app.

Q: How do I post a property? A: It takes 30 seconds:

Click the Blue '+' Button at the bottom.

Tap the exact spot on the map where the plot is.

Upload photos, add a price, and paste a YouTube video link if you have one.

You can even record a Voice Note (Audio) to explain the highlights in your local language!

For Buyers: Buying with Confidence
Q: How do I know if a property is safe to buy? A: Use our "Truth Engine." When viewing a property, click the Audit/Verify button. It helps you check critical risks:

FTL Check: Is the land inside a lake buffer zone? (Red Flag)

Road Width: Is the approach road wide enough for permissions?

Documents: See if the seller has uploaded verified EC or approvals.

Download Report: You can instantly download a PDF Truth Report to share with your lawyer or family.

Q: Can I see the property without visiting? A: Yes. Our "Welcome Card" features:

HD Zoom: Click the image to see crystal-clear details.

Video Demo: Watch a full video tour directly inside the app.

Satellite View: Zoom in on the map to see existing houses, roads, and greenery in real-time.

Q: I closed the ad but want to call the owner. Where did the number go? A: We have a "Sticky Contact Bar." Even if you close the ad to look at the map, a small bar remains at the bottom of your screen with the price and a "Call" button, so you never lose the connection.

General Questions
Q: Do I need to install an app from the Play Store? A: No installation required! Safe Land runs directly in your browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.). It works smoothly on any mobile or desktop, just like a website but with the power of an app.

Q: Is it free to use? A: Browsing the map and checking the "Truth Engine" is free for buyers. For Agents and Developers who want to post ads or use the "Exclusive Agent" features, please contact our sales team for package details.
